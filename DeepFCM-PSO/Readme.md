This repository provides the implementation of DeepFCM, an explainable AI framework for diagnosing Coronary Artery Disease using Myocardial Perfusion Imaging (MPI) and clinical data, as presented in “Explainable Deep Fuzzy Cognitive Map Diagnosis of Coronary Artery Disease: Integrating Myocardial Perfusion Imaging, Clinical Data, and Natural Language Insights” (Applied Sciences, 2023). DeepFCM combines a lightweight RGB-CNN for processing polar-map images with an FCM-based classifier that incorporates selected clinical features. The system produces not only accurate predictions but also clear visual and textual explanations using Grad-CAM and a natural-language interpretation module. This repository includes the complete pipeline—image preprocessing, CNN training, FCM modelling, PSO-based optimization, evaluation, and explainability tools—allowing users to reproduce the results reported in the study and adapt the method to their own datasets.
